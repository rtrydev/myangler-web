/** Latin path. View selection follows the *result shape*, not the

 *
 *    - **1 segment** — a single logical query, whether the input was
 *      one word ("water"), a known multi-word phrase ("thank you"),
 *      a "to <verb>" infinitive that collapses to its stripped head
 *      ("to protect" → "protect"), or an article-absorbed "a <noun>"
 *      that collapses to one tile carrying the noun's match
 *      ("a fish"). Render as the ranked reverse-lookup so the user
 *      sees every Burmese entry that owns the gloss, not a one-tile
 *      breakdown. Passing the *original* input to `lookupReverse`
 *      lets the lookup module's own `normalizeGloss` (lowercase,
 *      collapse-ws, strip leading ``"to "``) reshape the query into
 *      the canonical key — *except* for an article-absorbed segment,
 *      where we route the segment's `reverseLookupKey` (the post-
 *      article portion, "fish" for "a fish") because `normalizeGloss`
 *      does not strip leading articles and the literal "a fish" key
 *      finds nothing in `gloss_groups`.
 *
 *    - **≥ 2 segments** — genuine sentence structure (parse-it-into-
 *      tiles UX). Render the breakdown with one tappable tile per
 *      segment. Article-absorbed segments inside a sentence (e.g. the
 *      third tile of "I see a fish") render in the breakdown via the
 *      forward-lookup result the segmenter already attached — only the
 *      *whole-input collapses to one absorbed segment* case takes the
 *      reverseLookupKey re-route above.
 *
 *  Driving the choice off `segments.length` instead of an input-
 *  surface heuristic also stabilizes the view across keystrokes: a
 *  half-typed "to protec" registers as two unmatched atoms (breakdown,
 *  2 unknown tiles), and the moment the typo resolves to "to protect"
 *  the result collapses to one segment and the view smoothly returns
 *  to the single-query rendering. Without this rule the view would
 *  remain stuck in breakdown mode on a fully-resolved one-segment
 *  input.
 *
 *  Per-segment fuzzy rescue is intentionally NOT performed inside the
 *  segmenter — same rationale as the Burmese eager-exact path: it
 *  would surface noisy near-matches for common short connecting words
 *  like "is" or "the". */
